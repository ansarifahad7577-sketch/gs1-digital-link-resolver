# GS1 Digital Link Resolver

An open-source, self-hostable resolver for GS1 Digital Link URIs — the foundational routing layer for EU Digital Product Passports (ESPR/Ecodesign Regulation).

## What this is

Every product that carries a Digital Product Passport (DPP) under the EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR, EU 2024/1781) must have a machine-readable data carrier — a QR code or NFC tag — that encodes a standardised URL. That URL follows the **GS1 Digital Link** standard (ISO/IEC 15459).

When a consumer, logistics operator, or market surveillance authority scans the product, a resolver maps the URL to the correct DPP endpoint. Without a resolver, the QR code goes nowhere.

This project provides that resolver as a complete, self-hostable service:

- Parses GS1 Digital Link URIs per **GS1 Digital Link standard v1.2**
- Routes resolved URIs to DPP endpoints via declarative YAML configuration
- Handles **content negotiation** — HTML for browsers, `application/ld+json` for machines
- Publishes a **GS1 resolver description file** at `/.well-known/gs1resolver`
- Ships as a **single Docker image**, deployable in under 10 minutes

**Licence:** Apache 2.0 — use freely in any context, commercial or otherwise.

## Why this exists

Despite GS1 Digital Link being the mandatory URL scheme for every ESPR-compliant DPP, there is no mature open-source resolver. Every DPP platform — from individual brands to national authorities — must build this layer privately or depend on a commercial vendor.

This project removes that barrier.

## Supported GS1 Application Identifiers

| AI | Name | Example |
|----|------|---------|
| 01 | GTIN (primary key) | `/01/09780345418913` |
| 10 | Batch / Lot | `/10/BATCH2024` |
| 17 | Expiry Date | `/17/251231` |
| 21 | Serial Number | `/21/ABC123` |
| 22 | Consumer Product Variant | `/22/V2` |
| 235 | Third-Party Extended Packaging ID | `/235/TPX001` |

## Quick start

The release image ships on the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/grigolatoe/gs1-digital-link-resolver:1.1.0
```

That binds the resolver on `localhost:8080` with the example config bundled
into the image. To bring your own routes, mount over `/app/config/routes.yaml`:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./config/routes.yaml:/app/config/routes.yaml \
  ghcr.io/grigolatoe/gs1-digital-link-resolver:1.1.0
```

Then visit:

```
http://localhost:8080/01/09780345418913/21/ABC123
```

The resolver parses the GTIN (`09780345418913`) and serial (`ABC123`), looks up the routing rule, and returns an RFC 9264 link-set (or redirects to the default link if the client asked for HTML).

### Build from source instead

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grigolatoe/gs1-digital-link-resolver.git
cd gs1-digital-link-resolver
cp config/routes.example.yaml config/routes.yaml
docker build -t gs1-resolver .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./config/routes.yaml:/app/config/routes.yaml gs1-resolver
```

### Verify the published image

Every release is signed with a PGP key under the maintainer's direct
control (the same key attached to the NLnet NGI Zero Commons Fund
application). See **[SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md)** for the verification
procedure; the short version is:

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 47DE71F021C986123851E8AD65A8E29C92A63D38
gh release download v1.1.0 --repo grigolatoe/gs1-digital-link-resolver --pattern 'SIGNATURES-*'
gpg --verify SIGNATURES-v1.1.0.txt.asc SIGNATURES-v1.1.0.txt
docker pull ghcr.io/grigolatoe/gs1-digital-link-resolver:1.1.0
# The digest reported by docker must match the one in SIGNATURES-v1.1.0.txt.
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# config/routes.yaml
resolvers:
  # Note: GTIN-14 in DL URIs is left-padded with zero, so a "books"
  # company prefix of 978 appears in DL URIs as "0978..." — match accordingly.
  - match:
      gtin_prefix: "0978"
    target: "https://dpp.example.com/passport/{gtin}/{serial}"
    link_types:
      - rel: "gs1:pip"
        href: "https://dpp.example.com/passport/{gtin}/{serial}"
        type: "text/html"
        title: "Product Information Page"
      - rel: "gs1:verificationService"
        href: "https://dpp.example.com/api/verify/{gtin}/{serial}"
        type: "application/json"
      - rel: "gs1:digitalProductPassport"
        href: "https://dpp.example.com/dpp/{gtin}/{serial}.json"
        type: "application/ld+json"

  - match:
      primary_ai: "8003"          # GRAI for returnable assets
    target: "https://assets.example.com/grai/{8003}"

  - match: "*"                    # default fallback
    target: "https://id.gs1.org/01/{gtin}"
```

## Content negotiation

| Accept header | Response |
|---|---|
| `application/linkset+json` (default) | 200 RFC 9264 link-set with GS1 Web Vocabulary relation IRIs |
| `application/ld+json` | 200 JSON-LD link-set with `gs1:` context binding |
| `application/json` | 200 link-set in RFC 9264 shape |
| `text/html` | 302 redirect to the link-set's default link |
| `*/*` (or empty) | 200 RFC 9264 link-set |

The `?linkType=` query parameter (per GS1 DL §6.4) narrows the response to a single relation when provided. Q-values are honoured.

## Resolver description file (`/.well-known/gs1resolver`)

The GS1-Conformant Resolver Standard requires a resolver to publish a
machine-readable description of itself. This service serves one at
`/.well-known/gs1resolver` as `application/json`, and it validates against GS1's
published [description-file schema](https://ref.gs1.org/standards/resolver/description-file-schema).

The two mandatory fields are **derived from your running configuration**, so the
document cannot silently drift from what the resolver actually does:

- **`supportedPrimaryKeys`** — inferred from the primary keys your routes can
  actually match (`primary_ai` clauses, plus AI `01` wherever a `gtin_prefix` /
  `gtin_regex` clause appears). A catch-all route is deliberately *not* reported
  as `"all"`: declaring blanket support for every GS1 key is a conformance claim
  to make on purpose, not one to infer from a fallback rule.
- **`resolverRoot`** — the origin the request arrived on. Behind a
  TLS-terminating proxy, run uvicorn with `--proxy-headers` or set
  `resolver_root` explicitly.

Optional operator metadata goes in a `well_known:` block, which may be omitted
entirely:

```yaml
well_known:
  name: "Example DPP Resolver"
  resolver_root: "https://id.example.com"     # optional; else the request origin
  supported_primary_keys: ["01", "8003"]      # optional; else derived from routes
  terms_of_use: "https://example.com/terms"
  json_ld_context_location: "https://example.com/context.jsonld"
  contact:
    fn: "Example Brand B.V."
```

Keys are snake_case in YAML and map to the standard's camelCase properties.
An invalid block — an unknown key, a value that is not a GS1 primary key, a
wrong type — fails the service at **startup**, so a non-conformant description
file never reaches a running resolver.

## DPP validator hook

The resolver supports a pluggable validator that runs at resolve time and reports its outcome in the link-set response under `gs1:validationStatus`. Four implementations ship in-tree:

- **`noop`** (default) — zero overhead, never flags anything
- **`smoke`** — built-in URI-shape sanity checks (serial/lot character class, unknown AIs)
- **`schema`** — fetches the target DPP and validates it against a JSON Schema *you* supply, surfacing every violation
- **`http`** — delegate to an external DPP validator service: POSTs the resolved URI + target DPP URL to a configured `endpoint` and maps the verdict back

The `schema` and `http` validators need the optional extra (`pip install '.[validators]'`, which adds `httpx` + `jsonschema`); without it they degrade gracefully to a no-op. Configure via the `validator:` block in `routes.yaml`:

```yaml
validator:
  type: schema
  schema_path: /app/profiles/illustrative-dpp.schema.json   # bring your own
  profile: illustrative-dpp
```

**Profiles — bring your own.** There is, as of mid-2026, no canonical machine-readable CIRPASS-2 profile to bundle: CIRPASS-2 publishes data models and architecture docs, not JSON Schemas, and the closest emerging machine-readable standard — the [UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP)](https://untp.unece.org) — is still in pre-stable public review under a copyleft licence. So this repo ships only a small **illustrative, non-normative** profile (`profiles/illustrative-dpp.schema.json`) to exercise the validator; point `schema_path` at your own ESPR/UNTP-aligned schema for real compliance checks. See [`profiles/README.md`](profiles/README.md).

Operators can also implement the `Validator` protocol themselves. Validation outcomes are advisory — failures are surfaced in the response but never block resolution; any validator-side error (unreachable endpoint, unparseable body, missing optional dependency) degrades to a soft warning.

## Project status

**Stable — 1.1.** The configuration schema and HTTP contract are stable under
Semantic Versioning; see [docs/stability.md](docs/stability.md). Post-1.0
direction is tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Development of this resolver was **proposed to** the
[NGI Zero Commons Fund](https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund/) (NLnet Foundation,
EU-funded) in the June 2026 call; that application is under review. The work
below was built and released independently of its outcome.
